A couple of days ago I received the [Canvas Smart Desk][0] just weeks after backing it on Kickstarter. For $77 I think it is worth a look for anyone with a compatible device (they make a Surface Pro version too). The Canvas Smart Desk supports other configurations as well...

Other than potentially staining the bamboo desk even the very particular should be pleased with the quality of this product. After I use it daily for a few weeks I will provide a more in-depth review, but my initial reaction is a thumbs-up.
